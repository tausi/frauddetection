# Fraud Detection
Project with John Stewart

The purpose of this project is to utilize R to analyze and evaluate the different characteristcs of network intrusion sample data provided by *** bank to develop a netowrk anomaly detection system. This sample data will be used to determine what factors are indicative of a network intrusion, and develop statistical models to analyze and evaluate this system. This will enable the prediction and flagging of future network intrusions.
